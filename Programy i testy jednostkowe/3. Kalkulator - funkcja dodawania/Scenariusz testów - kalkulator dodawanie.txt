Feature: The Program adds two integers and returns a result

Scenario: Summing with zero
Given I test calculator
  When I add 0 and 3
  And Expected result is 3
  Then result is 3

Scenario Outline: Summing different numbers with zero for result <result>
  Given I test calculator
  When I add <num1> and <num2>
  And Expected result is <result1>
  Then result is <result>
  Examples:
    | num1 | num2 | result |  result1 |
    | 0    | 7    | 7      | 7        |
    | 0    | 0    | 0      | 0        |
    | -6   | 0    | -6     | -6       |
